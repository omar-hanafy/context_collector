// Context Collector - Clean Architecture Implementation
// 
// This is the refactored version following feature-based architecture principles:
// - Features are organized by domain (scan, editor, settings)
// - Each feature has clear layers (domain, data, presentation)
// - Shared utilities are centralized
// - Clean separation of concerns with renamed classes for clarity
