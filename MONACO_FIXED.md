# Monaco Editor Integration Fixes

## Fixes Implemented

Based on the health check analysis, the following issues have been addressed to ensure the Monaco Editor integration works properly on all platforms:

### 1. Package Versions
- Kept `desktop_webview_window` at version `^0.2.3` as it's the latest compatible version
- Ensured proper integration with transparent background fixes

### 2. Monaco Assets
- Added proper Monaco assets
- Copied `monaco-editor/min/vs` from simple-monaco-editor to `assets/monaco/vs/`
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` to include the Monaco assets folder

### 3. macOS Crash Fix
- Added platform check to avoid using transparent background on macOS:
```dart
if (!Platform.isMacOS) {
  _controller.setBackgroundColor(Colors.transparent);
}
```
- This prevents the "opaque is not implemented" error on macOS platforms

### 4. JavaScript â†” Dart Bridge
- Implemented a cross-platform messaging solution using a unified `notifyFlutter` function
- Added support for multiple communication channels:
  - Windows: `chrome.webview.postMessage`
  - macOS/Linux WebView: `flutter_inappwebview.callHandler`
  - Fallback: URL scheme with `window.location.href`

### 5. JSON Parsing
- Replaced the undefined `tryToMap` function with proper JSON decoding:
```dart
try {
  final data = (jsonDecode(message) as Map<String, dynamic>?) ?? {};
  final handler = data['handler']?.toString() ?? '';
  final args = data['args'] as List<dynamic>?;
  // ...
} catch (e) {
  print('Error processing WebView message: $e');
}
```

### 6. HTML Template Improvements
- Added Content Security Policy meta tag
- Added dark/light theme auto-detection using `window.matchMedia`
- Implemented offline fallback for Monaco loading
- Added error handling for loading assets

### 7. Offline Support
- Implemented a smart asset loading strategy:
  - Tries to use local Monaco assets first
  - Falls back to CDN when necessary
  - Checks `navigator.onLine` to determine availability of network

## Testing Recommendations

The integration should now work on all three desktop platforms:

1. **Windows**: The WebView2 integration works with either the built-in runtime or will prompt for installation
2. **macOS**: The transparent background issue is now fixed with the platform check
3. **Linux**: Uses WebKitGTK through the same interface as macOS

To test:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to update dependencies
2. Run `flutter clean` to ensure a fresh build
3. Test on each platform with `flutter run -d <platform>`
4. Test offline functionality by disconnecting from the internet

## Further Improvements

Consider the following future enhancements:

1. Choose one approach (embedded or pop-out window) for simplicity
2. Cache the temp file path in MonacoEditorWidget to avoid creating new temp files on each launch
3. Add more language detection patterns or implement a more robust detection system
4. Include Monaco's CSS files and icon fonts in the local bundle
5. Add tooltips to explain that the editor opens in a separate window (for the pop-out implementation)

All fixes have been implemented and the Monaco Editor should now function correctly across all desktop platforms.
