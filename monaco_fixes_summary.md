# Monaco Editor Fixes Summary

## Issue
Monaco Editor was timing out because of several compatibility issues between the optimized implementation and the original HTML/JS setup.

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Asset Loading
- Kept the temp file copying approach for desktop (required for file:// URLs)
- Added missing worker file: `base/worker/workerMain.js`
- Reduced file copying to only essential files for faster loading

### 2. Communication Channel
- Changed channel name from 'monacoFlutter' to 'flutterChannel' to match original
- Added support for 'onEditorReady' event instead of 'ready'
- Added URL scheme fallback handling
- Injected console.log interceptor for debugging

### 3. API Compatibility
- Fixed all controller methods to use window functions:
  - `window.setEditorContent()` instead of `window.monacoEditor.setContent()`
  - `window.setEditorLanguage()` instead of `window.monacoEditor.setLanguage()`
  - `window.setEditorTheme()` instead of `window.monacoEditor.setTheme()`
  - `window.setEditorOptions()` instead of `window.monacoEditor.updateOptions()`
  - `window.getEditorContent()` instead of `window.monacoEditor.getContent()`

### 4. Direct Editor Access
- Fixed format, find, goToLine, and scrollToTop to use window.editor directly
- Removed dependency on non-existent monacoEditor wrapper methods
- Implemented state save/restore manually using editor API

### 5. Initialization
- Added content setting in _onEditorReady
- Added small delay in onReady callback to ensure editor is fully initialized
- Fixed language detection by making window.detectLanguage available globally

## Key Changes:
- Uses original `index.html` instead of creating a new optimized version
- Maintains compatibility with existing editor API
- Properly handles ready events through multiple channels
- Includes all necessary language files for syntax highlighting

## Testing:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install synchronized package
2. Test editor loading on macOS
3. Verify syntax highlighting works for different languages
4. Check that resizable panels work correctly
