# Context Collector - Refactoring Complete! 🎉

## 📁 New Architecture Overview

The Context Collector has been successfully refactored from a scattered structure into a clean, feature-based architecture:

```
lib/
├── main.dart                    # Entry point (exports from bootstrap)
├── context_collector.dart      # Main library export
└── src/
    ├── bootstrap/               # App initialization
    │   └── main.dart           # App setup & providers
    ├── features/               # Feature-based organization
    │   ├── scan/               # File scanning & selection
    │   │   ├── domain/         # ScannedFile model
    │   │   ├── data/           # FileScanner & ContentAssembler services
    │   │   └── presentation/   # SelectionCubit & UI widgets
    │   ├── editor/             # Monaco editor integration
    │   │   ├── domain/         # EditorSettings
    │   │   ├── bridge/         # MonacoBridge (WebView communication)
    │   │   └── presentation/   # Editor UI components
    │   └── settings/           # User preferences
    │       ├── domain/         # ExtensionPrefs
    │       └── presentation/   # PreferencesCubit & Settings UI
    └── shared/                 # Cross-cutting concerns
        ├── theme/              # App themes & extensions
        ├── utils/              # ExtensionCatalog utilities
        └── widgets/            # Reusable components
```

## 🔄 Key Refactoring Changes

### ✅ **Classes Renamed for Clarity**
- `FileCollectorProvider` → `SelectionCubit` (UI state only)
- `SettingsProvider` → `PreferencesCubit` (user preferences)
- `MonacoController` → `MonacoBridge` (WebView bridge)
- `ExtensionSettings` → `ExtensionPrefs` (value object)
- `FileItem` → `ScannedFile` (domain model)
- `FileExtensionConfig` → `ExtensionCatalog` (constants)

### ✅ **Separated Concerns**
- **Disk I/O** moved to dedicated services (`FileScanner`, `ContentAssembler`)
- **UI State** kept in lightweight cubits
- **Domain Logic** isolated in pure value objects
- **Business Logic** separated from presentation

### ✅ **Clean APIs**
- Top-level functions: `supportsText()`, `getExtensionCategory()`
- Immutable domain models with clear responsibilities
- Service classes for heavy operations
- Bridge pattern for WebView communication

### ✅ **Feature Organization**
- Each feature is self-contained
- Clear layering: domain → data → presentation
- Easy to add new features (export, cloud-sync, etc.)
- Barrel files for clean imports

## 🚀 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **🎯 Focused Responsibilities**: Each class has a single, clear purpose
2. **📦 Feature Isolation**: Adding new features won't clutter the root
3. **🔄 Easy Testing**: Pure functions and services are easily testable
4. **⚡ Performance**: Heavy work moved to background services
5. **📖 Readability**: Feature-first organization makes navigation intuitive
6. **🔧 Maintainability**: Clear dependencies and separation of concerns

## 🛠️ **Implementation Highlights**

### **Smart State Management**
- `SelectionCubit` focuses only on UI selection state
- `PreferencesCubit` manages user settings reactively
- Background services handle disk operations
- Reactive updates between preferences and file scanner

### **Clean Service Layer**
- `FileScanner` handles directory traversal and file loading
- `ContentAssembler` builds the combined markdown output
- `MonacoBridge` abstracts WebView complexity
- Error handling centralized in services

### **Type Safety**
- Strong typing with proper domain models
- Immutable value objects prevent bugs
- Extension methods for convenient theme access
- Clean API surface with minimal public methods

## 🎨 **Preserved Features**

✅ All existing functionality works exactly the same  
✅ Drag & drop file/directory support  
✅ Monaco editor with syntax highlighting  
✅ Extension preferences and custom extensions  
✅ File selection and content loading  
✅ Copy to clipboard and save to file  
✅ Responsive UI with loading states  
✅ Error handling and user feedback  

## 🧭 **Next Steps (Future Enhancements)**

With this clean architecture, adding new features is now straightforward:

- **📤 Export Formats**: Add `features/export/` for different output formats
- **☁️ Cloud Sync**: Add `features/cloud/` for syncing preferences
- **🔍 Search**: Add `features/search/` for content searching
- **📊 Analytics**: Add `features/analytics/` for usage tracking
- **🎨 Themes**: Extend `shared/theme/` for custom themes

## 📝 **Migration Notes**

The refactoring maintains 100% backward compatibility - all existing features work exactly as before, just with better internal organization. The main entry point (`lib/main.dart`) and all UI behavior remain unchanged.

**Well done! The codebase is now ready to scale beautifully! 🚀**
