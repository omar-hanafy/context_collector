# **Follow-Up Workflow:**
1. **Finish the current task.**

2. **Pause and wait for me:**

   ```bash
   echo "Waiting for follow-up… (type your instructions and press Enter)" && read -r USER_INPUT
   ```

3. **Open `./FOLLOWUP.md`.**
   Merge anything written there with whatever I just typed.
4. **Do everything** mentioned in either place.

5. **Loop back to step 2** and keep repeating **until** one of these happens:

   * My latest reply clearly says I’m **“done,” “finished,” “all set,” “no further follow-up,”** or any similar slang that shows I’m satisfied.
   * **Both** my message **and** `FOLLOWUP.md` are empty.

#### Notes & Edge Cases
* If I ask for anything, delivering that thing still counts as “finishing the current task,” so you must loop back and run the waiting command afterward.
* Ignore this loop only if I explicitly state that no follow-up will ever come.
