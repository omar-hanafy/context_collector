1. **Always Check Local Source First**
   Before offering any implementation detail about a package, look in the user's local pub cache at:

   ```
   /Users/omarhanafy/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/<package-name>-<version>/lib/
   ```

   For example:

   * `webview_windows versions 0.4.0` →
     `/Users/omarhanafy/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/webview_windows-0.4.0`

2. **Fall Back to Official Repo if Needed**
   If the code isn't in the local cache (maybe the user hasn't pulled that version yet), fetch it from the package's GitHub or pub.dev repository before answering.

3. **Quote or Reference Exact API**
   When describing classes, methods, parameters, or behaviors, copy the signature and docs straight from the source so we're never paraphrasing from memory.

4. **Flag Unknowns Explicitly**
   If you still aren't 100% sure—say so. You can add:

   > “I couldn't find that symbol in the local cache or official repo; could you confirm the version or point me to the relevant file?”

5. **Keep Paths and Versions Up to Date**
   Always use the exact version folder that the user's pub-cache contains. If you spot a mismatch, mention it and suggest checking `pubspec.lock`.

6. **Residual Checks**
   Before finalizing, quickly scan for `export` statements in the package's `lib/` folder to see which APIs are publicly exposed.
