# Debug Logging Enhancement Summary

## Previous Debug Output from JetBrains

When dropping multi files:
```
=== DRAG AND DROP DEBUG ===
flutter: Total items dropped: 1
flutter:
Item 0:
flutter:   Path: /Users/omarhanafy/Development/MyProjects/sharek_app/FOLLOWUP.md
flutter:   Name: FOLLOWUP.md
flutter:   Type: DropItemFile
flutter:   Is DropItem: true
flutter:   Is DropItemFile: true
flutter:   Processing as DropItemFile
flutter:
=== SUMMARY ===
flutter: Files to add: 1
flutter:   - /Users/omarhanafy/Development/MyProjects/sharek_app/FOLLOWUP.md
flutter: Directories to add: 0
flutter:
Adding files...
flutter: [MonacoEditorContainer] Selection changed - has content: true
flutter:
=== END DEBUG ===
```

When dropping directory:
```
=== DRAG AND DROP DEBUG ===
flutter: Total items dropped: 1
flutter:
Item 0:
flutter:   Path: /Users/omarhanafy/Development/MyProjects/sharek_app/logs
flutter:   Name: logs
flutter:   Type: DropItemFile
flutter:   Is DropItem: true
flutter:   Is DropItemFile: true
flutter:   Processing as DropItemFile
flutter:
=== SUMMARY ===
flutter: Files to add: 1
flutter:   - /Users/omarhanafy/Development/MyProjects/sharek_app/logs
flutter: Directories to add: 0
flutter:
Adding files...
flutter: [MonacoEditorContainer] Selection changed - has content: true
flutter:
=== END DEBUG ===
```

When dropping single file it works normally.

## What We Added

I've enhanced the debug logging in `home_screen.dart` to capture ALL available metadata from the desktop_drop plugin when files are dropped. This will help diagnose the JetBrains multi-file drop issue.

### Complete List of Logged Properties:

1. **Drop Event Details**:
   - `localPosition` - Drop coordinates relative to the widget
   - `globalPosition` - Drop coordinates relative to the screen
   - `files.length` - Number of items received

2. **For Each Dropped Item**:
   - `runtimeType` - Actual type (DropItemFile vs DropItemDirectory)
   - `path` - Full file/directory path
   - `name` - Filename as selected by user
   - `mimeType` - MIME type if available
   - `length()` - File size in bytes (async)
   - `lastModified()` - Last modification timestamp (async)
   - `extraAppleBookmark` - macOS security-scoped bookmark data (if available)
   - `FileSystemEntity.typeSync()` - Actual filesystem type
   - Whether it's a temporary file (checks for `/tmp/` or `/var/folders/`)
   - For directories: `children.length`

### How to Test

1. Run the app in debug mode: `flutter run`
2. Try dragging multiple files from JetBrains
3. Check the console output for the debug information
4. Look for patterns like:
   - Does JetBrains send multiple DropItem objects?
   - Are there any special properties or metadata?
   - Is the Apple bookmark data present/different?

### What We Discovered About the Plugin

The desktop_drop plugin (v0.6.0) doesn't provide:
- Information about the source application
- Keyboard modifiers during drag
- Access to underlying pasteboard data
- Multiple file URLs in a single DropItem

This suggests the JetBrains limitation is likely at the pasteboard level, where JetBrains only puts one file reference in the drag data, even when multiple files are selected.

### Next Steps

Based on the debug output, we can:
1. Confirm if this is a JetBrains-specific issue
2. File an issue with the desktop_drop plugin if needed
3. Potentially implement a workaround using platform channels to access native drag & drop APIs directly
