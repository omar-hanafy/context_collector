# Plan B:
Looking at this Monaco editor integration codebase, I can see significant opportunities for code reduction while maintaining all functionality. Here's my comprehensive plan:

## Code Reduction Strategy

### 1. **Consolidate Asset Management** (~40% reduction)
- Merge `MonacoAssetManager` and status tracking into a single, simpler class
- Remove redundant state tracking (6 states → 3 states: loading, ready, error)
- Eliminate separate widget classes - use simple builders instead

### 2. **Simplify Bridge Layer** (~30% reduction)
- Create a unified platform adapter pattern instead of separate implementations
- Consolidate JavaScript injection scripts into templates
- Remove duplicate message handling code

### 3. **Streamline Settings Model** (~50% reduction)
- Replace massive `EditorSettings` class with a minimal core + extensions pattern
- Use JSON-based configuration instead of typed properties for rarely-used settings
- Remove preset management complexity - use simple JSON configs

### 4. **Unify UI Components** (~35% reduction)
- Merge all dialogs into a single configurable dialog system
- Extract common patterns into reusable widgets
- Simplify the info bar and remove redundant token counting features

### 5. **Simplify Service Architecture** (~25% reduction)
- Merge service and state management into a single provider
- Remove intermediate status tracking layers
- Simplify initialization flow

### 6. **Optimize Scripts and Data** (~20% reduction)
- Load language/theme data from JSON files instead of hardcoding
- Use string templates for JavaScript generation
- Consolidate debug helpers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Refactoring
1. **Create Minimal Core Types**
   ```dart
   // Simplified settings with JSON fallback
   class EditorConfig {
     final Map<String, dynamic> settings;
     T get<T>(String key, T defaultValue);
   }
   
   // Single state enum
   enum EditorState { loading, ready, error }
   ```

2. **Unified Platform Bridge**
   ```dart
   abstract class PlatformBridge {
     Future<void> initialize();
     Future<void> runScript(String script);
     Stream<String> get messages;
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Component Consolidation
1. Merge all UI dialogs into a single `EditorConfigDialog`
2. Create reusable `EditorToolbar` for all action buttons
3. Simplify asset loading to a single `FutureBuilder`

### Phase 3: Service Simplification
1. Single `MonacoEditorProvider` handling all state
2. Direct WebView integration without intermediate layers
3. Simplified initialization: assets → webview → ready

### Expected Results
- **Total code reduction**: ~35-40%
- **File count**: 26 files → ~12 files
- **Easier maintenance** with clearer architecture
- **Same functionality** with better performance


 I suggest
 beginning with the asset management system as it's the most self-contained
 and will show immediate benefits of reducing the code size.

Let me also share a plan from a third model (Plan C) that I found useful:
# Plan C: 

Of course. That's an excellent goal. Refactoring for simplicity and conciseness while maintaining functionality is a key part of the software development lifecycle.

Based on the provided codebase, here is a proposed plan to achieve your goal. We'll approach this in logical phases, starting with the least risky and most impactful changes first.

### Guiding Principles

1.  **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Widgets and classes should do one thing and do it well. Large widgets will be broken down.
2.  **Composition over Inheritance:** We will favor composing smaller, reusable widgets instead of having large, monolithic ones.
3.  **Consolidate State Management:** We will look for opportunities to simplify the state flow and reduce the number of separate, but related, state notifiers.
4.  **Extract and Abstract:** Repeated logic or UI patterns will be extracted into reusable functions or widgets.

---

### The Refactoring Plan

Here is a three-phase plan to incrementally refactor the editor feature.

#### Phase 1: UI and Widget Refactoring (High Impact, Low Risk)

This phase focuses on breaking down large UI widgets into smaller, more manageable, and reusable components. It's the safest place to start and will yield immediate improvements in code size and cleanliness.

* **1.1. Refactor `EnhancedEditorSettingsDialog`:**
    * **What:** This dialog is very large and contains many private builder methods (`_buildSwitchTile`, `_buildNumberField`, `_buildDropdownField`). These are perfect candidates for extraction.
    * **How:** We will create a new directory, `lib/src/features/editor/presentation/ui/settings_widgets/`, and create dedicated, reusable `FormField` widgets like:
        * `SettingsSwitchTile(title:, subtitle:, value:, onChanged:)`
        * `SettingsNumberField(label:, controller:, ...)`
        * `SettingsDropdownField<T>(label:, value:, items:, ...)`
    * **Why:** This will drastically reduce the line count of `enhanced_editor_settings_dialog.dart`, make the layout code much more declarative and readable, and give us a reusable toolkit for any future settings screens.

* **1.2. Extract the `EditorScreen` Sidebar:**
    * **What:** The `_EditorScreenState` currently manages the logic and UI for the slide-out "Quick Settings" sidebar directly within its build method.
    * **How:** We will create a new widget, `QuickSettingsSidebar`, that takes the `EditorSettings` and the various callbacks (`_toggleWordWrap`, `_increaseFontSize`, etc.) as parameters. The `EditorScreen` will simply instantiate this widget.
    * **Why:** This cleans up the `EditorScreen`'s build method, separating the main screen layout from the sidebar's specific implementation. It encapsulates the sidebar's logic and makes it easier to manage.

* **1.3. Decouple `MonacoEditorInfoBar` Components:**
    * **What:** The `MonacoEditorInfoBar` contains a complex, stateful sub-component, `_TokenCountChip`.
    * **How:** Extract `_TokenCountChip` into its own file. It's a self-contained unit with its own logic (debouncing, calculations) and deserves to be a standalone widget.
    * **Why:** This improves organization and simplifies the `monaco_editor_info_bar.dart` file, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

#### Phase 2: State Flow and Logic Consolidation (Medium Impact, Medium Risk)

This phase aims to simplify the core logic by streamlining the state management flow, which can reduce complexity and potential bugs.

* **2.1. Unify the Editor Lifecycle State:**
    * **What:** We currently have two separate state notifiers for the loading process: `MonacoAssetStatusNotifier` and `MonacoEditorStatusNotifier`. The editor service waits for the asset manager, indicating a single, linear process.
    * **How:** We can merge these into a single, unified state machine. We'll create one `EditorLifecycleNotifier` with a more comprehensive state enum:
        * `enum EditorLifecycleState { Initial, AssetsInitializing, AssetsCopying, EditorWebViewLoading, Ready, Error }`
        A single service or manager would control this entire flow from start to finish.
    * **Why:** This creates a single source of truth for the entire editor loading process, from asset copying to the editor being fully interactive. It simplifies the logic in the providers file and removes the need for services to listen to other services' states, reducing coupling.

* **2.2. Abstract `MonacoBridgePlatform` Actions:**
    * **What:** The `MonacoBridgePlatform` class is large because it includes dozens of methods for every conceivable editor action (`format`, `find`, `foldAll`, `selectAll`, etc.). Most of these are one-line calls to `_executeEditorAction`.
    * **How:** We can create a mixin, `MonacoEditorActions`, and apply it to the `MonacoBridgePlatform` class. This mixin would contain all the simple, one-line action methods.
    * **Why:** This separates the core responsibility of the bridge (managing the WebView connection, settings, and content) from the simple execution of commands. The main class file becomes smaller and more focused on its primary role, improving readability and organization.

#### Phase 3: Domain Model Refinement (Low Impact, Low Risk)

This phase focuses on improving the organization of the data models for better long-term maintainability.

* **3.1. Decompose the `EditorSettings` Class:**
    * **What:** The `EditorSettings` class is massive, with over 80 properties. While well-structured, it's difficult to navigate.
    * **How:** We can break it down into smaller, logical data classes using composition.
        * `class EditorSettings { final FontSettings font; final BehaviorSettings behavior; final DisplaySettings display; ... }`
        * `class FontSettings { final double fontSize; final String fontFamily; ... }`
        * `class BehaviorSettings { final WordWrap wordWrap; final int tabSize; ... }`
        We will need to update the `copyWith`, `fromJson`, and `toJson` methods to handle this new nested structure.
    * **Why:** This doesn't necessarily reduce the total lines of code but dramatically improves the organization and readability of the settings model. It makes it much easier to find and reason about related settings.

This phased approach allows us to make significant improvements incrementally, with clear verification steps along the way, ensuring we don't break existing functionality.

End of plans...

what I need u to do from here is to take my plans and yours in concideration and write the implementation that combines the best aspects of both approaches.
remember the goal is to reduce the code size while maintaining all functionality.

May I ask to use the model Opus 4 in full thinking mode?

Claudes final plan became:

Unified Implementation Plan: Combining Best Aspects of All Approaches

  After analyzing all three plans, here's my comprehensive implementation strategy that maximizes code reduction while maintaining functionality:

  Phase 1: UI & Asset Consolidation (40% reduction, Low risk)

  1. Asset Management Simplification
    - Merge MonacoAssetManager + status widget into single SimplifiedAssetManager
    - States: loading, ready, error (from 6 to 3 states)
    - Use FutureBuilder instead of separate widget classes
  2. Settings UI Refactoring
    - Delete editor_settings_dialog.dart
    - Extract reusable widgets from EnhancedEditorSettingsDialog:
    // New directory: presentation/ui/settings_widgets/
  - SettingsSwitchTile
  - SettingsNumberField
  - SettingsDropdownField
  - SettingsColorPicker
    - Extract QuickSettingsSidebar from EditorScreen
    - Extract TokenCountChip from MonacoEditorInfoBar
  3. Expected Impact: ~800 lines removed, 3 new small files added

  Phase 2: State & Service Unification (35% reduction, Medium risk)

  1. Unified Lifecycle State
  // Single state machine instead of two
  enum EditorLifecycle {
    initial,
    assetsLoading,
    webviewInitializing,
    ready,
    error
  }
    - Merge MonacoAssetStatusNotifier + MonacoEditorStatusNotifier
    - Merge monaco_editor_state.dart → monaco_editor_service.dart
  2. Bridge Simplification
  // Extract 30+ one-line methods into mixin
  mixin MonacoEditorActions {
    Future<void> format() => executeAction('format');
    Future<void> selectAll() => executeAction('selectAll');
    // ... etc
  }
  3. Expected Impact: ~600 lines removed, cleaner architecture

  Phase 3: Domain Model & Configuration (30% reduction, Low risk)

  1. Settings Decomposition with JSON Fallback
  class EditorSettings {
    final CoreSettings core;        // Essential settings only
    final Map<String, dynamic> advanced; // JSON for rarely used

    T getSetting<T>(String key, T defaultValue) =>
      advanced[key] ?? defaultValue;
  }

  class CoreSettings {
    final FontSettings font;
    final BehaviorSettings behavior;
    final DisplaySettings display;
  }
  2. Constants Consolidation
    - Merge monaco_data.dart + other constants → editor_constants.dart
    - Load themes/languages from JSON files instead of hardcoding
  3. Expected Impact: ~500 lines removed, more flexible configuration

  Implementation Order & Timeline

  Week 1: Phase 1 (UI/Asset) - Immediate visible impact
  - Day 1-2: Asset management consolidation
  - Day 3-4: Settings UI extraction
  - Day 5: Sidebar/InfoBar refactoring

  Week 2: Phase 2 (State/Service) - Core architecture
  - Day 1-2: Unified lifecycle state
  - Day 3-4: Service consolidation
  - Day 5: Bridge actions extraction

  Week 3: Phase 3 (Domain/Config) - Final polish
  - Day 1-2: Settings decomposition
  - Day 3: Constants consolidation
  - Day 4-5: Testing & cleanup

  Final Expected Results

  - File count: 24 → 14 files (~42% reduction)
  - Code size: ~35-40% total reduction
  - Architecture: Cleaner separation of concerns
  - Maintainability: Significantly improved
  - Performance: Same or better (less state tracking)
  - Functionality: 100% preserved

  Key Success Factors

  1. Start with Phase 1 for quick wins
  2. Test thoroughly after each phase
  3. Keep backwards compatibility during transition
  4. Document architectural decisions
  5. Use code generation where appropriate (json_serializable)

Would you like me to begin implementing Phase 1? I'll start with the asset management consolidation and settings UI extraction.
