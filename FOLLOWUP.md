```
'yarn.lock',
'pubspec.lock',
'composer.lock',
'gemfile.lock',
```

does it has the ability to block specific file with extension or specific extension

for example pattern to end with *.lock 

or *.g.dart and *.freezed.dart

does our refactor handle this cases

That is an excellent and crucial question. You've identified a key limitation in the simple plan I initially outlined.

My initial proposal could only handle simple, single-part extensions (like `.log`). **It would NOT correctly handle specific filenames like `pubspec.lock` or multi-part extensions like `*.g.dart`.**

You are right to question this. A tool for developers absolutely needs to handle these cases.

### The Problem with the Initial Plan

The initial logic I proposed was: `blacklist.contains(path.extension(fileName))`.

* For `my_file.g.dart`, `path.extension()` returns only `.dart`. You can't block `.g.dart` without blocking all Dart files.
* For `pubspec.lock`, `path.extension()` returns `.lock`. You couldn't block just `pubspec.lock` without also blocking `yarn.lock`.

### The Enhanced Refactoring Plan

We need to make the filtering logic more intelligent. Instead of checking for an exact match of the *extension*, we should check if the **file name ends with** any of the patterns in the blacklist.

This is a small change in the code but a massive improvement in functionality.

**Action:** Here is the updated filtering logic that should be used in both `FileScanner` and `DropHandler`.

```dart
// Path: lib/src/features/scan/services/file_scanner.dart (and DropHandler)

// ... inside the file processing loop
final fileName = path.basename(entity.path);

// First, handle the universal rule for hidden files
if (fileName.startsWith('.')) {
  continue;
}

// --- UPGRADED & POWERFUL FILTERING LOGIC ---
bool isBlacklisted = false;
for (final pattern in blacklist) {
  // Check if the filename ENDS WITH the blacklist pattern.
  // This handles all cases:
  // - '.log' matches my_app.log
  // - '.g.dart' matches my_file.g.dart
  // - 'pubspec.lock' matches pubspec.lock
  if (fileName.endsWith(pattern)) {
    isBlacklisted = true;
    break; // Match found, no need to check further
  }
}

if (isBlacklisted) {
  continue; // Silently skip
}
// --- END OF LOGIC ---

// ... (rest of the file processing logic)
```

### How This New Logic Solves Everything:

With this single change from `blacklist.contains(extension)` to `fileName.endsWith(pattern)`, your system can now handle all the cases you mentioned:

1.  **Block a specific file name?**
    * **Yes.** Just add the full name `pubspec.lock` to the blacklist array. The code `fileName.endsWith('pubspec.lock')` will only match that exact file.

2.  **Block a simple extension (`*.lock`)?**
    * **Yes.** Add `.lock` to the blacklist. The code `fileName.endsWith('.lock')` will match `pubspec.lock`, `yarn.lock`, etc.

3.  **Block multi-part extensions (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`)?**
    * **Yes.** Add `.g.dart` and `.freezed.dart` to the blacklist. `fileName.endsWith('.g.dart')` will correctly identify and block generated Dart files while leaving your source `*.dart` files untouched.

### Updated Default Blacklist

Your default blacklist should also use these more specific patterns for generated Dart files, as they are a perfect example of context "noise".

```dart
// Recommended update for your default blacklist
static const Set<String> defaultBlacklist = {
    // ... all the previous entries

    // Dart/Flutter Generated Files
    '.g.dart',
    '.freezed.dart',
    'pubspec.lock',

    // Other lock files by name
    'package-lock.json',
    'yarn.lock',
    // ...etc
};
```

Thank you for asking this follow-up. It makes the proposed refactor significantly more robust and genuinely useful for real-world development projects.

quick note: read the files before updating it cuz it might be changed or updated externally.
