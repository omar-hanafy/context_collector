# Context Collector - Extension Settings Update

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented a customizable extensions feature for your Context Collector app. Here's what was added:

### New Features

1. **Settings Screen** - Accessible via settings icon in the app bar
   - View all supported extensions grouped by category
   - Enable/disable individual extensions
   - Add custom extensions with category selection
   - Bulk operations (Enable All, Disable All Default, Reset to Defaults)
   - Visual indicators for custom extensions (star icon)

2. **Persistent Storage** - Using shared_preferences
   - User preferences are saved and restored between app sessions
   - Custom extensions are preserved
   - Disabled extensions are remembered

3. **Dynamic Extension Support**
   - The app now uses the active extensions from settings instead of hardcoded ones
   - File scanning respects the enabled/disabled state
   - Custom extensions are treated the same as default ones

### Files Modified/Created

1. **New Files:**
   - `lib/models/extension_settings.dart` - Settings data model
   - `lib/providers/settings_provider.dart` - Settings state management
   - `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Settings UI
   - `setup.sh` - Setup script for running flutter pub get

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `pubspec.yaml` - Added shared_preferences dependency
   - `lib/main.dart` - Added MultiProvider for settings
   - `lib/config/file_extensions.dart` - Added methods for settings support
   - `lib/models/file_item.dart` - Added settings-aware methods
   - `lib/providers/file_collector_provider.dart` - Integrated settings provider
   - `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Added settings button and provider connection
   - `lib/widgets/file_list_widget.dart` - Updated to use active extensions

### How to Use

1. **First Time Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/omarhanafy/scripts/context_collector
   chmod +x setup.sh  # Make the script executable
   ./setup.sh         # Run flutter pub get
   ```
   
   Or run directly:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/omarhanafy/scripts/context_collector
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d macos
   ```

3. **Using the Settings:**
   - Click the settings icon in the app bar
   - Toggle extensions on/off by clicking them
   - Add custom extensions using the "Add Custom Extension" button
   - Use the menu (three dots) for bulk operations

### Features Highlights

- **Smart Defaults**: All existing extensions are enabled by default
- **Visual Feedback**: Custom extensions have a star icon
- **Category Organization**: Extensions are grouped by their categories
- **Smooth UX**: Real-time updates when toggling extensions
- **Error Handling**: Validation for custom extensions (must start with dot, can't duplicate)

The app now dynamically checks the enabled extensions when:
- Scanning directories for files
- Determining if a file can be loaded
- Displaying file information in the UI

Custom extensions are fully integrated and behave exactly like default ones!
