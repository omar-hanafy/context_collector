> **Combine files & folders into a clean, AI-ready text bundle ‚Äî powered by Flutter and Monaco Editor.**

Context Collector is a lightweight desktop app (macOS ‚Ä¢ Windows ‚Ä¢ Linux) that lets you drag-and-drop source files, logs, configurations, or entire directories and outputs a neatly annotated document.
Every chunk includes full file paths and metadata, making it ideal for working smoothly with large-language models (LLMs) without the hassle of manual copying and pasting.

2. **Toggle** files to include/exclude from your combined context.
3. **Review & edit** the assembled content inside the Monaco editor.

## üìå Why Context Collector?

| *"ChatGPT keeps asking 'where's that widget defined?'"* | Bundles related Dart, Swift, HTML, etc., files into one cohesive, prompt-ready bundle.      |
| *"Sharing repro steps means pasting multiple logs."*    | Drag your entire `logs` directory; text files merge automatically and binaries are skipped. |
| *"Losing track of copied files."*                       | Path headers and file-size indicators clearly organize your context.                        |
| *"Long prompts blow up my token budget."*               | Quickly toggle files on/off or collapse content to control token usage.                     |
