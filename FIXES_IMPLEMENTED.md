# Fixes Implemented for Context Collector

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Clear All Files**
**Problem**: When clearing all files, they weren't actually being removed from the tree.
**Solution**: Updated `clearFiles()` in `file_list_state.dart` to call `virtualTree?.clearTree()` before resetting state.

### 2. **Duplicate Directory Handling**
**Problem**: Dropping the same directory again created duplicates without asking the user.
**Solution**: 
- Implemented duplicate detection in `processDroppedItems()` that checks if source paths already exist in scan history
- Shows `DuplicateHandlingDialog` with three options:
  - **Merge New**: Only add new files (default)
  - **Replace All**: Remove existing files and add fresh
  - **Keep Both**: Create duplicates with unique IDs

### 3. **Selection/Deselection Sync**
**Problem**: Deselecting items in tree didn't update editor content.
**Solution**: Already working correctly through selection callbacks. When a file is deselected in tree, it calls `onSelectionChangedCallback` which updates the scanner state and rebuilds content.

### 4. **Remove Functionality**
**Problem**: Remove wasn't completely cleaning up state.
**Solution**: Enhanced `removeNode()` in tree state to:
- Collect all file IDs being removed (including children)
- Remove from tree structure recursively
- Notify scanner of each removed file
- Update selection state

### 5. **Code Cleanup**
**Solution**: Made code more concise by:
- Simplified file icon logic using sets instead of switch statements
- Extracted menu item builder to reduce duplication
- Cleaned up regex patterns
- Removed unused methods and imports
- Fixed all dart analyzer errors

## Additional Improvements

1. **Context Passing**: Updated all UI components to pass `BuildContext` for showing dialogs
2. **Tree Clear**: Enhanced `clearTree()` to properly reset all state and notify scanner
3. **Error Handling**: Fixed type issues and added proper null checks
4. **File Organization**: Removed duplicate `virtual_tree_impl_fixed.dart` file

## How It Works Now

1. **Drop Files**: When dropping files/folders, the system checks for duplicates and asks user preference
2. **Selection**: Tree selection is bidirectionally synced with scanner state
3. **Remove**: Removing nodes properly cleans up all related state
4. **Clear All**: Completely resets both scanner and tree state
5. **Content Update**: Any selection change immediately updates the Monaco editor content

All analyzer errors have been fixed and the code is now cleaner and more maintainable.
